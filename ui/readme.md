## Developing

You will need to specify the project directory relative to your host machine
to get this component running:
```bash
export UI_DIR=$PWD
# or, if you're already in a container
export UI_DIR=/home/user/location-of-project/ui
```

After this, run docker compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
